# Scorecard
**Scorecards** provide an organization with an ideal way for executing and controlling its strategy by tracking the right **Key Performance Indicators (KPI's)** in comparison to corresponding **targets** and as such enabling visibility in every direction. Furthermore scorecarding helps in **aligning and empowering** the different teams and departmental layers which are present in an organization, by effectively **communicating goals and their actual performance** in a consistent way.
